# Car Rental System Planning & Analysis

Welcome to the comprehensive planning and analysis documentation for a modern car rental system graduation project.

## Project Overview

This documentation represents the **planning and requirements engineering phase** of a full-stack car rental system. The goal is to produce academic-quality documentation that will serve as the foundation for system implementation.

### Objectives

1. **Analyze Existing Solutions**: Study three open-source car rental projects to extract proven patterns and features
2. **Research Industry Standards**: Investigate best practices, compliance requirements, and competitive features
3. **Identify Stakeholders**: Document all user types and their needs across the rental ecosystem
4. **Define Workflows**: Create visual representations of user journeys and system processes
5. **Catalog Features**: Build a comprehensive inventory of system capabilities
6. **Write Requirements**: Produce formal, EARS-compliant requirements specifications

## Documentation Structure

This site is organized into the following sections:

- **Methodology**: Our approach to analysis and research
- **Project Analysis**: Detailed examination of bookcars, car-rental-php, and FreeCar
- **Market Research**: Industry standards, trends, and competitive analysis
- **Stakeholders**: User types, goals, and pain points
- **Workflows**: User scenarios with visual diagrams
- **Features**: Comprehensive feature catalog by category
- **Requirements**: Formal requirements specification
- **Appendices**: Glossary, references, and traceability matrices

## Key Features of This Documentation

- **Modular Structure**: Each section is broken into focused, maintainable files
- **Visual Diagrams**: Mermaid flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and state diagrams
- **Technology Agnostic**: Patterns abstracted from specific implementations
- **Academic Quality**: Suitable for graduation project submission
- **PDF Export**: Complete documentation available as a single PDF

## Analyzed Projects

### 1. BookCars
A comprehensive, multi-platform car rental solution with:
- Admin panel, customer frontend, and mobile app
- Modern technology stack
- Full-featured booking and fleet management

### 2. Car-Rental-PHP
An educational PHP-based implementation demonstrating:
- Monolithic architecture
- Traditional MVC pattern
- Simple, clear database schema

### 3. FreeCar
A cloud-native, microservices-based system featuring:
- Go-based microservices
- Service mesh architecture
- Modern observability and scalability patterns

## Target System Scope

The requirements cover a comprehensive car rental platform including:

- **Mobile Applications** (iOS & Android)
- **Web Applications** (Customer-facing & Responsive)
- **Admin Panels** (Fleet, User, and Location Management)
- **Payment Processing** (Multiple gateways, secure transactions)
- **Fleet Management** (Vehicle tracking, maintenance, availability)
- **Analytics & Reporting** (Business intelligence, dashboards)
- **Third-Party Integrations** (Maps, payments, notifications, insurance)
- **Multi-language & Multi-currency Support**

## Getting Started

Navigate through the documentation using the sidebar. We recommend starting with the **Methodology** section to understand our analysis approach, then proceeding through the project analyses and research findings.
