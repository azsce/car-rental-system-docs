Understanding their strategies, features, and service offerings provides valuable insights for graduation project planning. Both companies have evolved from simple vehicle rental operations into comprehensive mobility service providers, though they approach the market with different philosophies and target audiences.

The revenue model centers on:

The company encompasses multiple brands including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental, and Alamo Rent A Car, each targeting different market segments.

### Business Model

Enterprise differentiates itself through:

- **Neighborhood Locations**: Strategic placement in residential and business areas rather than just airports

Enterprise's signature "We'll Pick You Up" service differentiates the brand by providing free transportation to rental locations. This feature addresses a key pain point in the rental process and demonstrates customer-centric thinking.

#### Neighborhood Locations

Unlike competitors focused primarily on airports, Enterprise maintains extensive networks of neighborhood locations convenient for local rentals. This strategy captures market segments underserved by airport-centric competitors.

#### Long-Term Rental Programs

Enterprise offers flexible long-term rental options that function similarly to subscription services, providing alternatives to vehicle ownership or leasing for customers needing extended vehicle access.

## Lessons for Graduation Projects

### Customer Segmentation

Both companies demonstrate the importance of clear customer segmentation. Successful platforms must identify target segments and tailor features, pricing, and marketing accordingly. The B2B vs B2C split shows that different segments have fundamentally different needs and value propositions.

### Loyalty and Retention

Loyalty programs like Hertz Gold Plus Rewards prove effective for customer retention and lifetime value optimization. Graduation projects should consider how to build customer loyalty beyond just competitive pricing.

### Technology Balance

Hertz's contactless rentals and Enterprise's pick-up service show different approaches to customer convenience. Technology should enhance rather than complicate the customer experience. The best solution depends on target segment preferences.

### Geographic Strategy

The contrast between Hertz's airport focus and Enterprise's neighborhood strategy demonstrates that location strategy significantly impacts market positioning and customer segments served. Graduation projects must carefully consider where to deploy services.

### Fleet Management

Both companies show that fleet management is core to rental business success. Decisions about vehicle acquisition, maintenance, utilization optimization, and residual value capture directly impact profitability.

### Partnership Ecosystems

Strategic partnerships with airlines, hotels, insurance companies, and travel agencies extend market reach and provide customer acquisition channels. Graduation projects should identify potential partnership opportunities early.
